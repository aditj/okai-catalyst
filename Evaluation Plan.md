Problem Analysis Skills Evaluation Plan
1. Introduction & Purpose
This document outlines a comprehensive plan for evaluating the problem analysis skills of managers and team leaders in a manufacturing environment. The primary audience for this assessment is both new and existing personnel within MSMEs and MNCs.
The goal is to create a robust, scalable, and objective assessment that goes beyond theoretical knowledge. It will measure a candidate's practical ability to identify, analyze, and address operational problems, even if they haven't had formal training in specific methodologies like Six Sigma or Lean.
This evaluation will serve as a key input for the Human Resources department to identify skill gaps and design targeted training programs, ultimately fostering a culture of continuous improvement and operational excellence. The assessment will be heavily powered by LLM technology for dynamic content generation, evaluation, and analysis.
2. Core Skills for Evaluation
The assessment will focus on the following core problem-solving competencies:
Problem Definition & Scoping: The ability to clearly and concisely define a problem, distinguishing between symptoms and root causes.
Data Analysis & Interpretation: The ability to use and interpret data to understand the scope and impact of a problem. This includes a conceptual understanding of tools like Histograms.
Structured Root Cause Analysis (RCA):
Categorization of Causes: The ability to systematically categorize potential causes of a problem, demonstrating an understanding of the 6M (Ishikawa/Fishbone) framework (Man, Machine, Material, Method, Measurement, Motherland/Environment).
Deep-Dive Analysis: The ability to drill down to the fundamental root cause of an issue, showcasing the logic behind the Why-Why Analysis.
Solution Identification & Prioritization: The ability to propose logical, data-driven solutions and prioritize them based on impact and feasibility.
Communication & Articulation: The ability to clearly articulate the problem, analysis, and proposed solutions in a structured manner.
3. Assessment Framework: A Case Study Approach
The evaluation will be centered around a series of realistic manufacturing case studies. This approach allows for the assessment of practical, on-the-job problem-solving skills in a controlled environment.
3.1. Case Study Generation (LLM-Powered)
Dynamic Scenarios: The LLM will generate a wide range of case studies based on pre-defined parameters, ensuring that each candidate receives a unique but equivalent assessment.
Scenario Parameters:
Industry: (e.g., Automotive, Pharmaceuticals, FMCG)
Problem Type: (e.g., Quality defects, production delays, safety incidents, cost overruns)
Available Data: (e.g., Production logs, quality control reports, operator feedback, machine maintenance records)
Complexity: (e.g., Single vs. multiple root causes, availability of clear data)
3.2. Assessment Structure
Each case study will be presented in a multi-stage format, guiding the candidate through a structured problem-solving process.
Stage
Description
Skills Assessed
LLM Role
1. Problem Briefing
The candidate is presented with a concise overview of a manufacturing problem.
Problem Comprehension
Generate case study
2. Information Gathering
The candidate can "request" additional information (from a predefined set) to better understand the problem.
Data-driven approach, critical thinking
Provide relevant data points
3. Problem Definition
The candidate must articulate a clear and specific problem statement.
Problem Definition
Evaluate the clarity and accuracy of the problem statement
4. Root Cause Analysis
The candidate is prompted to identify potential causes and the ultimate root cause, guided by the 6M and Why-Why frameworks.
6M, Why-Why Analysis
Generate targeted questions, evaluate the logical flow of the analysis
5. Solution Proposal
The candidate proposes a set of solutions and a brief justification for their recommendations.
Solution Identification
Assess the feasibility and relevance of the proposed solutions
6. Rationale & Reflection
The candidate explains the reasoning behind their analysis and proposed solutions.
Articulation, metacognition
Analyze the depth of understanding and self-awareness

4. Evaluation & Scoring (LLM-Powered)
The LLM will play a crucial role in evaluating the candidate's responses at each stage of the assessment.
4.1. Automated Scoring Rubric
A detailed scoring rubric will be developed to ensure objective and consistent evaluation. The LLM will be trained to use this rubric to score the candidate's responses.
Skill
Evaluation Criteria
Problem Definition
- Clarity and conciseness
- Focus on the core issue, not just symptoms
- Use of available data to quantify the problem
6M Analysis
- Identification of relevant causes in each category
- Logical connection between causes and the problem
Why-Why Analysis
- Depth of analysis (at least 3-5 "Whys")
- Logical progression from symptom to root cause
Solution Proposal
- Feasibility and practicality of solutions
- Clear link between solutions and the identified root cause

4.2. Pattern Recognition and Analysis
Beyond individual scores, the LLM will analyze response patterns across multiple candidates to identify common areas of strength and weakness within the organization. This will provide invaluable data for strategic workforce development.
5. Reporting & Feedback
The output of the assessment will be a comprehensive report for both the candidate and the HR department.
5.1. Candidate Report
Overall Score: A summary of their performance.
Skill-Level Breakdown: A detailed look at their strengths and areas for development across the core competencies.
Personalized Feedback: LLM-generated feedback with specific examples from their assessment.
Development Plan: Recommendations for training and on-the-job learning to address identified skill gaps.
5.2. HR/Management Report
Individual & Team Performance: An overview of individual and team-level results.
Organizational Skill Gaps: Identification of common weaknesses across the organization.
Training Recommendations: Data-driven recommendations for group training programs and workshops.
6. Implementation Roadmap
Phase 1: Platform Development (M 1-3):
Develop the user interface for the assessment.
Integrate the LLM API for dynamic content generation and evaluation.
Develop and refine the scoring rubric and feedback mechanisms.
Phase 2: Pilot Program (M 4):
Conduct a pilot with a small group of managers to validate the assessment's effectiveness and gather feedback.
Refine the case studies, questions, and scoring based on pilot results.
Phase 3: Full Rollout & Continuous Improvement (M 5+):
Launch the assessment across the organization.
Continuously monitor the performance of the assessment and the LLM, making improvements as needed.
This evaluation plan provides a comprehensive framework for developing a cutting-edge, LLM-powered assessment to enhance the problem-solving capabilities of your clients' workforce.
